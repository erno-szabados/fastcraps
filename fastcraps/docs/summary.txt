Fast Craps - a quick, simple Craps variant

Played with two dice.

Overview

The basic objective is for the shooter to win by rolling the Point 
again before he rolls a 7. That 7 is called Out 7 to differentiate it 
from the 7 on the Set the Point roll.  
If the Point is rolled, the shooter wins and the round is over.  
If the shooter rolls Out 7, they lose and the round is over.  
If the toss is neither the Point nor Out 7, the round continues and the 
dice keep rolling.

There is only a single bet implemented, and there are four rolls to resolve.

Pass Bet

Made before the "Set the Point" roll.

1. The Pass bet is made before the "Set the Point" roll, the equivalent 
to the come out roll in craps.
2. If the Set the Point roll is a 7, then the Pass bet pushes (it's a tie.). 
3. If the Set the Point roll is an 11, then the Pass bet wins. 
4. If the Set the Point roll is a 2, 3, or 12, then the Pass bet loses.
5. Otherwise, whatever was rolled becomes the Point. The object is to 
roll the point again, within three more rolls, and without rolling a 
seven. The odds depend on the point and on which roll it was rolled a 
second time, according to the pay table below.
6. If a seven is rolled after the Set the Point roll, or the player 
goes three rolls without rolling the point or a seven, then the Pass 
bet loses.
