Fast Craps - a quick, simple Craps variant

Played with two dice.

Overview

The basic objective is for the shooter to win by tossing the Point 
again before he tosses a 7. That 7 is called Out 7 to differentiate it 
from the 7 on the Come Out roll.  
If the Point is tossed, the shooter and his fellow bettors win and the 
round is over.  
If the shooter tosses Out 7, they lose and the round is over.  
If the toss is neither the Point nor Out 7, the round continues and the 
dice keep rolling.

There are two bets maximum, four rolls to resolve.

Pass Bet

Made before the "Set the Point" roll.

1. The Pass bet is made before the "Set the Point" roll, the equivalent 
to the come out roll in craps.
2. If the Set the Point roll is a 7, then the Pass bet pushes. 
3. If the Set the Point roll is an 11, then the Pass bet wins even 
money. 
4. If the Set the Point roll is a 2, 3, or 12, then the Pass bet loses.
5. Otherwise, whatever was rolled becomes the Point. The object is to 
roll the point again, within three more rolls, and without rolling a 
seven. The odds depend on the point and on which roll it was rolled a 
second time, according to the pay table below.
6. If a seven is rolled after the Set the Point roll, or the player 
goes three rolls without rolling the point or a seven (I'll call this 
getting three strikes), then the Pass bet loses.

Pass Bet Pay Table

ROLL		POINT
-			4,10		5,9		6,8
1			5 to 1		4 to 1	3 to 1
2			4 to 1		3 to 1	2 to 1
3			3 to 1		2 to 1	1 to 1

Brick Bet

This is an optional bet.

1. The Brick bet is made before the "Set the Point" roll.
2. If the Set the Point roll is a 7 or 11, then the Brick bet pushes. 
3. If the Set the Point roll is a 2, 3, 5, 9, or 12, then the Brick bet
 loses. 
4. Otherwise, whatever was rolled becomes the Point. The object is to 
roll the point again the hard way* within three more rolls, and without 
rolling a seven or the point the easy way**. A win pays 25 to 1.
5. If the player rolls a seven, rolls the point the easy way, or goes 
three rolls after the Set the Point roll without doing either, then the 
Brick bet loses.

* The Hard Way is rolling a particular even number with both dice 
landing on the same face. For example, a five and five would be called 
a hard 10.
** The Easy Way is rolling a particular even number with both dice 
landing on difference faces. For example, a four and six would be 
called an easy 10.
